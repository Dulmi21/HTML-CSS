Flexbox and Grid are two layout models in CSS that enable developers to create responsive and flexible designs, but they have different use cases and functionalities. Here's a brief overview of the key differences between Flexbox and Grid:

Layout Model:

Flexbox: Designed for one-dimensional layout, either in a row or a column. It is suitable for arranging items along a single axis.
Grid: Designed for two-dimensional layout, allowing you to create a grid of rows and columns. It is suitable for arranging items in both rows and columns simultaneously.
Orientation:

Flexbox: Primarily used for laying out items in a row or column.
Grid: Supports both rows and columns, offering more control over the layout.
Main Purpose:

Flexbox: Ideal for distributing space along a single axis and aligning items within a container. It is commonly used for building navigation bars, sidebar layouts, and centering items.
Grid: Suited for creating complex layouts where you need to control both rows and columns. It is useful for building overall page structure and aligning items in a grid format.
Alignment:

Flexbox: Provides properties like justify-content and align-items for controlling the alignment of items along the main and cross axes.
Grid: Offers properties like justify-items and align-items to control the alignment of items within the grid cells.
Responsive Design:

Flexbox: Well-suited for building flexible and responsive components within a container, but it may not be as efficient for complex overall page layouts.
Grid: Powerful for creating responsive layouts and adapting to different screen sizes. It allows you to define how many columns or rows an item should span, making it highly adaptable.
